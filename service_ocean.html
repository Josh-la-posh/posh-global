In any delivery situation, having options and executing to a plan are critical to logistical success. That’s why ground cargo broker service by SunFun Global Logistics is your go-to solution when it absolutely has to be there tomorrow, on time.

Via SunFun Global Logistics’s carrier network, you have access to over 50,000 expedited freight vehicles ready to go nationwide, from Sprinter vans to full-sized tractor trailers. Vehicle freight payload capacities can range anywhere from 2,000 to 44,000 pounds, with decks, doors and beds to accommodate almost any sized freight. All utilize the latest logistics technology to maintain speed and efficiency while using satellite tracking technology to ensure you know the status of your delivery every step of the way.

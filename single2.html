                        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3" style="color: #dc3545;">How Companies Are Saving Valuable Time by Using SunFun Global Logistics Air Freight Services</h4>
                        <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-left mr-4 mb-2" src="img/b2.jpg">
                        <p>Efficient airfreight services are vital when your company’s products must be delivered over long distances within a short period of time. Airfreight transportation is also extremely helpful if an organization needs to obtain specific parts, tools, or necessary items quickly from <span style="color: #6610f2;"> <strong><em>various suppliers in multiple locations</em></strong> </span>.<br><br>Air cargo services are the most reliable, safest, and fastest method of transit compared to other types of surface transportation. So why should your business use air cargo services to save valuable time and resources?<br><br>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>1.  There is no downtime<br><br></strong></p><p>There’s no downtime when items are sent or picked up using airfreight, which means that your valuable inventory won’t waste time sitting in a storage facility or warehouse. Additionally, shipments and pickups made through companies such as AirFreight can reach virtually any location in North America within just a few hours.<br><br>This quick turnaround helps air cargo operators and ground handlers expedite the shipping process, making them much more efficient with your cargo. Because your inventory stays on the same plane during the entire duration of its journey, it’s also handled less. This means there’s a much lower chance of a shipment getting lost or damaged since it’s not getting loaded, unloaded, and stored numerous times.<br><br>Customers also have the convenience of working with a single point of contact during the entire shipping process, which means they speak to the same expeditor each time they call and don’t have to repeat their account information during each phone call. Real-time tracking updates and alerts are also sent to their mobile devices via text message or email, so they know where their shipment is at all times.<br><br></p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>2.  Travel is fast<br><br></strong></p><p>Air cargo services are the only type of freight delivery capable of traveling long distances within short periods of time. Air cargo services will select the quickest and most optimal route for your shipment’s journey, analyzing weather patterns and current air traffic to determine the best route. Identifying multiple paths to the intended destination will ensure your shipment arrives safely and on time—even when faced with unexpected delays or severe weather conditions.<br><br>When utilizing airfreight, businesses don’t have to worry about ground-related travel disruptions such as traffic delays, road construction, or auto accidents that could potentially add hours to a delivery or pickup.<br><br>Multiple air transportation options—air cargo, airfreight, and air charter—can accommodate a wide variety of shipment sizes and even the tightest deadlines. Each plane is also vetted to ensure it meets the strictest capacity and safety standards.<br><br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>3.  You get quick service<br><br></strong> </p><p>Air cargo services such as AirFreight offer the convenience of fast service. Once the size and capacity of your shipment are determined, they go to work immediately, selecting the fastest, most cost-effective mode of air transit to pick up or deliver your goods. Once you’ve utilized their services, your account information is stored securely in their customer base. The next time you need a shipment delivered, they’ll have immediate access to your account details, saving you valuable time.<br><br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>4.  You can send your freight almost anywhere.<br><br></strong> </p><p>As supply chain shortages continue across the U.S., more businesses are turning to alternative North American suppliers in Mexico or Canada. Luckily, both countries are easily accessible by flight. Additionally, airfreight doesn’t face the same limitations that ground transit or expedited ground travel can encounter, such as slow traffic, ground weather issues, road closures, and more.<br><br>Traveling above congested or heavily trafficked areas allows air cargo to reach difficult or distant delivery points that other methods of transportation cannot access.<br><br></p>

                        <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-3" style="color: #dc3545;">Why Ocean Shipping Companies are Buying Cargo Planes</h4>
                        <p>Supply chain issues resulting from the COVID pandemic are leading some of the world's biggest shipping line companies to buy their own fleets of cargo planes.<br><br>Although air cargo is still prohibitive for some manufacturers and retailers due to its higher cost, demand has nonetheless surged during the past year while port backlogs dragged on. Dozens of ships continue to wait outside major port cities such as Los Angeles, Antwerp, Tianjin and Ningbo. Ships are often forced to wait weeks to load or unload their cargo.<br><br>According to shipping company executives, they intend to use the planes to bolster their ocean freight business. It may also mark a move towards these companies acting as end-to-end logistics providers.<br><br>However ocean-shipping companies still operate a small number of planes compared with leading air freight companies. FedEx, UPS and Deutsche Post AG have approximately 1,000 aircraft at hand and can take care of hundreds of flights every day. Ocean-shipping companies are mostly looking to ship pallets loaded with various goods instead of bundles of smaller packages.<br><br>Acquisitions in the industry also point in this direction. Last year Maersk paid $644 million for freight forwarding specialist Senator International.<br><br>Once completed, the buyout is expected to double Maersk's total air cargo volume. In 2019, CMA CGM bought CEVA Logistics for $1.67 billion, then went on to launch its own air freight service.<br><br>According to the International Air Transport Association air freight makes up less than 1% of global trade by volume but 35% by value. Cargo planes are capable of moving everything from food to auto supplies.  During the pandemic they have been used to transport vital products and goods such as semiconductors, vaccines, medical equipment, technology products and clothing. It's also been increasingly common for planes to transport lithium batteries for electric cars and other uses.<br><br>On average, air freight costs six times the amount of ocean cargo but during the pandemic the price gap has shrunk significantly due to historically high ocean freight prices.

                        <img class="img-fluid w-50 float-right ml-4 mb-2" src="img/b3.jpg">
                        <p>Shipping emergencies don’t happen every day, but when they do happen, you don’t want to be scrambling to find a solution when productivity or thousands in revenue are on the line. That’s why it’s important that you find an expedited freight delivery company that values your money and time and can be a long-term partner.<br><br>Especially today, current supply chain disruptions and retail shortages across the globe are leading even the most well-prepared companies to find themselves facing problems they’ve never previously experienced.<br><br>If you’re a warehouse, plant, or factory manager, it’s important to have a plan and know who to turn to in worst-case scenarios. Here are five advantages that SunFun Global Logistics offers over other shipping services:<br><br></p>
                    <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>1.  Save time with immediate service.<br><br></strong></p><p>As soon as you <span style="color: #6610f2;"> <strong><em>contact SunFun Global Logistics</em></strong> </span> to send or pick up a shipment, an expeditor begins working and gathering data immediately. As they receive more information, they get to work immediately, which includes exploring the best price options and plane for the job, analyzing relevant traffic or weather conditions, and identifying the most accessible and quickest routes. With SunFun Global Logistics, you can count on spending less time waiting around for answers you need quickly.<br><br></p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>2.  Avoid dealing with call centers.<br><br></strong></p><p>The same expeditor communicates with you throughout the entire shipping process, from pickup to delivery, and they’re available at any time, <span style="color: #1F1F2E;"> <strong>24/7/365</strong> </span>. That means no unnecessary wait times contacting a customer support center. There are also no frustrating transfers to multiple agents while waiting for the information or tracking updates you need.<br><br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>3.  Get one point of contact dedicated to you and your shipment.<br><br></strong> </p><p>Your single point of contact vets each plane carefully to ensure that it has the capacity and resources to protect and haul your shipment from pickup to delivery. That means your shipment gets to where it needs to be quickly and without any surprises. The best part? SunFun Global Logistics offers straightforward payment options with no hidden delivery fees, helping you get the best and most competitive rate available.<br><br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>4.  Feel confident your shipment will be safe.<br><br></strong> </p><p>Any damage that occurs during the shipping process is unacceptable and may not be usable when received. That’s why SunFun Global Logistics upholds the <span style="color: #6610f2;"> <strong><em>strictest safety standards</em></strong> </span> in all of its deliveries using secure packing, protecting pallets and items from damage.<br><br>Shipments made using AirFreight.com are also handled less, which means that the inventory is much less likely to be handled poorly or carelessly. SunFun Global Logistics deliveries won’t waste any time sitting in warehouses or distribution centers waiting for available carriers. Once inventory is picked up, it’s sent immediately to the intended destination.<br><br></p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;color: #1F1F2E"><strong>5.  Gain a long-term partnership.</strong></p>
            <p>After you’ve sent or received a shipment using SunFun Global Logistics, your account information is stored in a database for future shipments. The onboarding process for first-time customers requires a few more steps to set up an account, but the process goes quickly once payment terms have been established. Advanced logistics software also gathers data surrounding available pilots, drop-off locations, pickup times, and more.<br><br></p>
